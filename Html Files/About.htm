<p style="text-align: left" ><b><h4 style="text-align: left">The Problem:</h4></b> In public spaces it's hard to tell when it's apropriate to talk to people and strike up a conversation. Even if the person is availible what do you talk about? What do you have in
	common? Many times people miss out on making a new friend with many similarities, sometimes even niche qualities, that are
	impossible to see without outside information. </p>

  <p style="text-align: left"><b><h4 style="text-align: left">The Solution:</h4></b> Simply provide a service that shows people with similar interests at whatever location you may be, be it
	at your favorite coffee shop, hackathon, or bar. This eliminates the all to common intial question that essentially is
	"what subject can we have a meaningful conversation about?". And instead someone can enter any event or establish look
	on the map for and immediatly feel comfortable talking to someone new and potentionaly making a new friend in the process. </p>

  <p style="text-align: left"><b><h4 style="text-align: left">Our Approach:</h4></b> An android and iOS app that allows the user to declare what their status or topic of discussion is, and then
	show that person as on icon on the map. Filtering that person to similar people that have that interest near them. Not only
	that but also showing events / establishments with lots of people with similar interest or is related to their status. For example
	someone with the video game status may be alerted to the osu epsorts club or even the osu gaming hub in morril tower.
	Another example would be a user that has the programming status, and them being shown upcoming events such as hack oh/io, or
	coding work shops on campus. </p>
